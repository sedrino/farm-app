- `app/server/db/queries` - Drizzle DB queries.
- `app/query/mutations` - @tanstack/react-query mutation hooks.
- `app/query/options` - @tanstack/react-query query options.

Our goal is not to create a production ready application, but generate a mostly complete application that starts as a good starting point.
The generation does create errors. We are working on reducing the number of generated errors.
